# AIcoach (React + FastAPI)

This is a react application that is made on reactjs platform and leverages streamchat.io . This application leverages GeminiAI to generate answer prompts from user prompts and stores that data via it's postgres database. Then it utilizes that experience to remember data for the user and generates future prompts. It sounds simple and that's generally what I aim to provide users. Simple.
This and its backend counter part is hosted on render.io(it was cheap :D)



## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
